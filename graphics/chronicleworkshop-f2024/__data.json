The short story assigned for this event is \"Frankenstein\" by Mary Shelly. I want to present a different image of Frankenstein's monster. Normally, it is presented as brainless, scary monster. But I found this picture of Frankenstein's monster on Pinterest. I have never seen the movie but I think this moment shows a good glimpse of humanity in the monster that we've never seen.","/images/graphics/ChronicleWorkshop-f2024.png","ChronicleWorkshop-f2024","2024-11-17"],"uses":{"params":["work"]}}]}
