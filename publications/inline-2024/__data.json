However, debugging these systems is challenging due to the intertwined nature of software and hardware issues. Existing tools often require hardware instrumentation or log visualization through serial monitors. To address this, the authors designed Inline, a programming tool that simplifies debugging by displaying hardware logs directly within the code, providing real-time execution flow tracking and an expression language for log manipulation. A study with twelve users demonstrated the tool’s effectiveness in aiding debugging tasks.","A programming tool that simplifies debugging by displaying hardware logs directly within the code, providing real-time execution flow tracking and an expression language for log manipulation.","/images/publications/inline.png",[9,12,14],{"label":10,"color":11},"Physical Computing","primary",{"label":13,"color":11},"Debugging",{"label":15,"color":11},"Programming",[17,18,19,20,21,22],"Andrea Bianchi","Zhi Lin Yap","Punn Lertjaturaphat","Austin Z.
