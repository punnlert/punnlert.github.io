When I was young I didn't think I'd have the head for design. I never was the kid who draws best in class or the one who people would ask to make the group poster. I'd always think that design is all about those things, you know? Making aesthetic choices, being able to draw so effortlessly, knowing how to choose fonts.

But being involved in design projects showed me that, while skill is important, being a designer isn't about what you can make but more about how much you _cared_. It's about being in other's shoes, imagining what it feels like. It's about carefully developing a process and executing it with respect in you craft. And most importantly, it's about bringing out the joy and imagination out of others, whether it be your users or your teammates.

Being at the intersection of so many disciplines, I'm always excited to meet people who sees the world from different lenses and shares the love for creativity. The impact designs can have on our lives inspires me to strive to do my best. Previously, I designed a [new financial experience for kids](/oink), [To-do application for workaholics](/baobal), and a [space shooting game that fosters relationships](/roger-roger). I was a member of [Make Lab](https://make.kaist.ac.kr/), KAIST and was a part of one of their HCI paper, [Inline](https://make.kaist.ac.kr/project/inline-2024). Now, I'm looking for a new opportunity to express my ideas.

I'm currently pursuing my double major degree in Industrial Design and Computer Science at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/). While I'm not studying or interning in labs I work as a freelance graphic designer for clubs, designing their posters and magazine. And while I'm not doing those things, I'm probably reading fictions, talking to every shopowners around my apartment, or writing letters to my friends.
