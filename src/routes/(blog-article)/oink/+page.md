## Context
Oink is an attempt to reshape the financial experience for kids and preteens. The problem with the current financial experience is that it is so... *in the air*, in a sense that you cannot really touch it; the money you have is just *numbers* on the screen. 

It may make sense for adults that have to manage their complex finance (I am also trying to learn how to be financially responsible) but it does not make sense for kids who just started to learn about money. So, what we're trying to do was bring back some of charming characteristics of physical money to digital banking tools for children.

## Overview and Background
**Primary Research**  
After our initial research, we came to realize this problem from the two observations 
1. **Financial experimenting during childhood is important**
2. **The financial literacy in Korea is low** (and I believe it can also be said for the most part of the world)

**Surveys**  
Then, we conducted some surveys to see how relevant are those two points and get more detailed explaination for them.

We found that around 50% of children switched from using cash to debit card at around 12-14 years old. The main reason they make the switch is because of ***convenience*** (which, i know, is obvious but we like to make sure). 

The interesting part is what changed after they started using digital money. There are some positive changes like the children gets more freedom to spend but that eventually leads to negative effects like overconsumptions and lack of planning.

**Problem**  
The problem we see here is that the change from physical money to digital one is maybe too sudden.
