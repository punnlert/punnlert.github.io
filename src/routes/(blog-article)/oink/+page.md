## Context

Oink is an attempt to reshape the financial experience for kids and preteens. The problem with the current financial experience is that it is so... _in the air_, in a sense that you cannot really touch it; the money you have is just _numbers_ on the screen.

It may make sense for adults that have to manage their complex finance (I am also trying to learn how to be financially responsible) but it does not make sense for kids who just started to learn about money. So, what we're trying to do was bring back some of charming characteristics of physical money to digital banking tools for children.

## Overview and Background

**Primary Research**  
After our initial research, we came to realize this problem from the two observations

1. **Financial experimenting during childhood is important**
2. **The financial literacy in Korea is low** (and I believe it can also be said for the most part of the world)

**Surveys & Interview**  
After we had our base hypothesis, we designed a series of survey and interview questions to better define the problem in details.

The result is them compiled and analyze into more digestible presentation.

We found that around 50% of children switched from using cash to debit card at around 12-14 years old. The main reason they make the switch is because of **_convenience_** (which, i know, is obvious but we like to make sure).

The interesting part is what changed after they started using digital money. There are some positive changes like the children gets more freedom to spend but that eventually leads to negative effects like overconsumptions and lack of planning.

## Problem

The problem we see here is that the change from physical money to digital one may be too sudden. From physical assets that you can **see**, reduced to just a numerical representation on a screen.

In order to better encouragr good financial habit since teenage year, maybe a better transition to help children acclimated themselves to the digital financial world.

Another problem is that financial education needs to start early but it's not always easy to have an effective financial conversation between kids and parents.

And that's the overarching theme of out problem; "Transition Period of Cash to Digital Money"

## Target User

So, we decided our target user to be 7-13 years old kids and their parents. If the product is expected to ship in 4-5 years, they would be

- **Kids**  
  [_Alpha Generation_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Alpha)  
  The biggest feature of Alpha Generation is that they are the generation directly influenced by the popularization of smartphones and the ubiquitous society. They will grow up and become a member of the financial world.

- **Parents**  
  [_MZ Generation_](https://en.namu.wiki/w/MZ%EC%84%B8%EB%8C%80)  
  Generation MZ (a South Korean specific term) refers to the Millennials who were born in the early to mid-1990s, and Generation Z who were born in the mid to late 1990s. It is a generation with characteristics of diversity, leisure-oriented, value-based consumption (environmental and ethical values), self-centered, digital native, and fun-seeking.

## Goals

We set some goals and objective for each goal so we have a common understanding among members and other stakeholders.

1. **create a seamless transition from physical to digital money**  
   to achieve this we need to
   - Help them understand the value of digital money
   - Visualize digital money
   - Simulate the physical manipulation of digital money
2. **Form good money management habits**  
   to encourage good habits we need to
   - Make savings appealing
   - Foster thoughtful spending and saving
3. **Encourage conversations about money between kids and parents**
   - Provide talking topic and common place to talk
